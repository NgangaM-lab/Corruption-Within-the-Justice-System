<section id="intro">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="card">
    Corruption is defined as the abuse of power for personal gain, especially among individuals in positions of authority. The justice system refers to institutions responsible for ensuring fairness, enforcing laws, and protecting citizens. This research explores whether corruption within justice systems contributes to rising crime levels globally.

    <div class="quote">
      Nearly 80% of respondents identified corruption as the biggest barrier to accessing justice (EACC, 2023).
    </div>

    This project was inspired by observing how corruption weakens institutions and undermines trust in law enforcement. The research examines causes, consequences, and both national and global perspectives.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="causes">
  <h2>Causes of Corruption</h2>
  <div class="card">
    One major cause of corruption within the justice system is the <span class="highlight">lack of accountability mechanisms</span>. Weak administrative oversight allows corruption to occur without detection, eroding the rule of law and diminishing public trust.

    Another significant factor is <span class="highlight">excessive discretion</span> given to justice officials. While discretion allows flexibility in decision-making, it also creates opportunities for abuse of power.

    <div class="accordion">
      <button onclick="toggleAcc(this)">More Causes</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        Additional drivers include underfunded institutions, weak anti-corruption laws, and cultural normalization of bribery. When systems lack transparency and oversight, corruption becomes embedded within institutions.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="effects">
  <h2>Consequences</h2>
  <div class="card">
    Corruption in the justice system leads to severe societal consequences. One of the most immediate effects is <span class="highlight">limited access to justice</span>. Bribery and favoritism create barriers that prevent equal treatment under the law.

    More importantly, corruption leads to <span class="highlight">loss of public trust</span>. When citizens believe the system is unfair, they may turn to alternative forms of justice such as vigilantism or mob justice.

    <div class="quote">
      Corruption weakens judicial capacity and encourages illegal alternatives to formal justice systems (UNODC, 2017).
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="perspectives">
  <h2>Global vs National Perspectives</h2>
  <div class="card">
    Globally, corruption in justice systems is widely recognized as a barrier to fairness and development. Countries with strong judicial institutions, such as Nordic nations, consistently report lower corruption levels and higher public satisfaction.

    <p><b>Ukraine Case Study:</b> In contrast, Ukraine provides a national perspective marked by widespread mistrust. Protests in 2020 and 2025 demonstrated public frustration with judicial corruption and weakened anti-corruption laws.</p>

    Both perspectives reveal a shared theme: corruption erodes trust and weakens institutional legitimacy. However, the Ukrainian perspective highlights direct citizen activism and political pressure for reform.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="evaluation">
  <h2>Evaluation of Sources</h2>
  <div class="card">
    This research relied on credible global organizations such as Transparency International and Deutsche Welle. Transparency International operates in over 100 countries and focuses on holding powerful institutions accountable. Deutsche Welle provides internationally verified journalism supported by expert analysis and corroborated reporting.

    Using multiple reputable sources strengthened the reliability of this research and ensured balanced perspectives.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="action">
  <h2>Course of Action</h2>
  <div class="card">
    Without strong reforms, corruption within justice systems could continue to increase crime and societal instability. Several solutions can address this issue:

    <ul>
      <li>Strengthening monitoring of courts and judicial institutions</li>
      <li>Introducing stricter penalties for corrupt officials</li>
      <li>Expanding anti-corruption agencies' powers</li>
      <li>Improving transparency through public awareness campaigns</li>
      <li>Reforming laws to enhance accountability</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="reflection">
  <h2>Reflection and Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="card">
    This research revealed that corruption within justice systems is not only widespread but deeply impactful. It undermines fairness, fuels mistrust, and contributes to rising crime levels. The Ukrainian case study demonstrated how corruption can trigger public protests and institutional instability.

    Initially, the scale of this issue was underestimated. However, the research led to a significant shift in perspective. It is now clear that corruption within the justice system can directly and indirectly lead to increased crime by weakening trust, accountability, and the rule of law.
